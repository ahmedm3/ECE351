#####Requirements:
- Verilog Simulator (can be ModelSim, iverilog, etc..)
- Python3.4 if you want to re-run the vector generator
- gcc if you want to re-run the vector generator for the logical operations
- if you're using a mac and iverilog, you need vvp, as well as gtkwave if you want to look at waveforms
